How to use vinted-api by Androz

## Introduction

Since [Androz](https://github.com/Androz2091) released his [vinted-api](https://github.com/Androz2091/vinted-api), some people asked me how to make something that doesn't repost posts already selected by your program.
Here is an example, see in [`index.js` file](./index.js)

## Important

Make sure to have the [`ids.json` file](./ids.json) in your program.
